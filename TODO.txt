x) Figure out unicode rendering (Is it font related?)
x) Rounded Corners
x) Complete data-flow overhaul. Implement 23 algorithm.

BUGS:

-VSync causes a lot of problems with the inputs. For example, when dragging the
|graphics can run {-NumOfBackBuffers} frames behind the mouse causing a weird thing
|where the object being dragged doesn't feel good. Disabling V-Sync fixes all of this,
|but it's not a good solution to force on the user.

-The text is sometime renderered a bit blurry? Could it be the sampling? Or is there another
|bug? For example, in the demo file-browser, if we set the font to size 16 and use Consolas,
| the text in the "forward" and "backward" buttons becomes blurry. Not sure why.
